1. Which of the following are operators, and which are values?

* (operator)
'hello' (value)
-88.8 (value)
- (operator)
/ (operator)
+ (operator)
5 (value)


2. Which of the following is a variable, and which is a string?

spam (variable)
'spam' (string)


3. Name three data types.

Integer, String, Float


4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

Expressions consist of values and operators and always evaluate down to a single value. You can use expressions anywhere in Python code where you could also use values. 


5. This chapter introduced assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

An assignment tells the programme the value (i.e. spam = 10) where as expressions consist of values and operators. 


6. What does the variable bacon contain after the following code runs?

bacon = 20
bacon + 1

20


7. What should the following two expressions evaluate to?

'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3

Both will result with 'spamspamspam'


8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

Intergers (100) and floats (100.00) cannot be used as variable names. 


9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?

str(), int(), and float()


10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?

'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'

Python gives an error because the '+' operator can only be used to add two integers together or concatenate two strings.


Extra credit: Search online for the Python documentation for the len() function. It will be on a web page titled “Built-in Functions.” Skim the list of other functions Python has, look up what the round() function does, and experiment with it in the interactive shell.
