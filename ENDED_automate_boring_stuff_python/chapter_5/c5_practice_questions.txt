1. What does the code for an empty dictionary look like?

dictionary = {}


2. What does a dictionary value with a key 'foo' and a value 42 look like?

dictionary = {'foo': 42}


3. What is the main difference between a dictionary and a list?

Dictionaries are useful because you can map one item (the key) to another (the value), as opposed to lists, which simply contain a series of values in order.


4. What happens if you try to access spam['foo'] if spam is {'bar': 100}?

You'll get a KeyError message. 


5. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam (a) and 'cat' in spam.keys() (b)?

a. 'cat' in spam checks if the key 'cat' is present in the dictionary spam.
b. 'cat' in spam.keys() checks if the string 'cat' is a key in the dictionary spam. The result will be a boolean value.


6. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.values()?

a. 'cat' in spam checks if the key 'cat' is present in the dictionary spam.
b. 'cat' in spam.values() checks if the value 'cat' is present in any of the values in the dictionary spam. The result will be a boolean value.


7. What is a shortcut for the following code?

if 'color' not in spam:
    spam['color'] = 'black'

spam.setdefault('color', 'black')


8. What module and function can be used to “pretty print” dictionary values?

The correct module is pprint, but the correct function is pprint.pprint(). The pprint module provides a pprint() function for pretty-printing dictionaries, lists, and other data structures. The pprint module needs to be imported, and then you can use pprint.pprint() for pretty printing.
